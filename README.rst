Summary
-------

This sphinx extension can be used to build a collection of
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__ notebooks for Sphinx Projects.

**Note:** It has mainly been written to support the use case of
scientific publishing and hasn't been well tested outside of this
domain. Please provide feedback as an issue to this repository.

**Requires:** Sphinx >= 1.7.2 (for running tests)

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter

to get the latest version it is best to install directly by getting a copy of the repository, and

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Update project ``conf.py`` file to include the jupyter extension
and the desired **Configuration** settings (see configuration_ section below):

.. code:: python

    extensions = ["sphinxcontrib.jupyter"]

then run

.. code:: bash

    make jupyter

Usage in RST Files
------------------

A minimum configured sphinx repo is available `here <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal>`__
which generates a `sample notebook <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal#simple_notebookrst>`__

To generate an ``In`` style executable block you can use

.. code:: rst

    .. code-block:: python

.. code:: rst

    .. literalinclude::  

To include code in the notebook that is not meant for execution can be
included using ``:class: no-execute``. This is useful when writing code
that is meant to throw errors, for example.

.. code:: rst

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: no-execute

this will generate a highlighted markdown cell of the contents of the
code-block. An alias for this is ``:class: skip-test``. This is used
in the context of a test environment that is using the collection of 
notebooks to test a collection of code snippets.

.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The following additions must be made to ``conf.py`` file.

.. code:: python

    # --------------------------------------------
    # sphinxcontrib-jupyter Configuration Settings
    # --------------------------------------------

    # Conversion Mode Settings
    # If "all", convert codes and texts into jupyter notebook
    # If "code", convert code-blocks only
    jupyter_conversion_mode = "all"

    jupyter_write_metadata = True

    # Location for _static folder
    jupyter_static_file_path = ["_static"]

    # Configure Jupyter Kernels
    jupyter_kernels = {
        "python3": {
            "kernelspec": {
                "display_name": "Python",
                "language": "python3",
                "name": "python3"
                },
            "file_extension": ".py",
        },
        "julia": {
            "kernelspec": {
                "display_name": "Julia 0.6.0",
                "language": "julia",
                "name": "julia-0.6"
                },
            "file_extension": ".jl"
        }
    }

    # Configure default language for Jupyter notebooks
    # Can be changed in each notebook thanks to the ..highlight:: directive
    jupyter_default_lang = "python3"
 
    # Configure Jupyter headers
    jupyter_headers = {
        "python3": [
        ],
        "julia": [
        ],
    }

    # Prepend a Welcome Message to Each Notebook
    jupyter_welcome_block = "welcome.rst"

TODO
----

1. remove need for Jupyter headers from configuration
2. include support for adding output to In cells to give a precompiled look to generated notebook
3. `Issues list <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter/issues>`__
