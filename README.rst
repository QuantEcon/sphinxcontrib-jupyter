Summary
-------

This sphinx extension can be used to build, execute a collection of
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__ notebooks for Sphinx Projects and convert them to html. Execution of notebooks and creation of html files can be turned on/off by configuration variables mentioned later in the doc.

**Note:** It has mainly been written to support the use case of
scientific publishing and hasn't been well tested outside of this
domain. Please provide feedback as an issue to this repository.

**Requires:** Sphinx >= 1.7.2 (for running tests). 

Demo
----
   * https://lectures.quantecon.org/ - series of lectures on quantitative economic modeling

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter

to get the latest version it is best to install directly by getting a copy of the repository, and

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Update project ``conf.py`` file to include the jupyter extension
and the desired **Configuration** settings (see configuration_ section below):

.. code:: python

    extensions = ["sphinxcontrib.jupyter"]

then run

.. code:: bash

    make jupyter

Usage in RST Files
------------------

A minimum configured sphinx repo is available `here <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal>`__
which generates a `sample notebook <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal#simple_notebookrst>`__

To generate an ``In`` style executable block you can use

.. code:: rst

    .. code-block:: python

.. code:: rst

    .. literalinclude::  

To include code in the notebook that is not meant for execution can be
included using ``:class: no-execute``. This is useful when writing code
that is meant to throw errors, for example.

.. code:: rst

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: no-execute

this will generate a highlighted markdown cell of the contents of the
code-block. An alias for this is ``:class: skip-test``. This is used
in the context of a test environment that is using the collection of 
notebooks to test a collection of code snippets.

Exercise Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extension has support for ``:class: solution`` on code-blocks. This
allows for the compilation of two sets of notebooks, one containing solutions
and one without.


Test Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~

Other class options for code-blocks include `test` to indicate the 
code block contains a test which can be used for adding test logic
for automatic testing of notebooks. This is by default set to `False`
in the configuration and all test blocks are dropped.



Jupyter Directive and Slides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``jupyter`` directive accepts three different arguments ``cell-break``, ``slide`` and ``slide-type``
How to use them is explained bellow


cell-break
++++++++++

.. code:: rst
    
    .. jupyter::
        :cell-break:

it is used to break a `markdown_cell` in two, this is done for example, when a paragraph 
is too large to fit in one slide.

slide
+++++

If the user wants to create a notebook where the cells are converted into
slides the folowing code needs to be included at the top of the .rst file.

.. code:: rst

    .. jupyter::
        :slide: {{enable/disable}}

``:slide: enable`` activates the slideshow metadata into the jupyter notebook, 
setting as a default value that each **cell** is a **slide**. 
The directive detects automatically the different cells 
(going from a ``markdown_cell`` to a ``code_cell`` for example), 
but also new cells are created when a subtitle is detected. If the user wants to force
a new cell, the option ``cell-break`` can be added.



slide-type
++++++++++

The default value for each cell would be ``slide``. If the user wants
to change the upcoming cell to something different (``subslide``, ``fragment``, ``notes``, ``skip``)
the following code must be included

.. code:: rst

    .. jupyter::
        :slide-type: subslide



Other Supported Directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``.. note::`` - the raw contents of this directive is included 
into the notebook as a block quote with a **Note** title.
1. ``.. only::`` - this will skip any only content that is not jupyter 

.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The following additions must be made to ``conf.py`` file.

.. code:: python

    # --------------------------------------------
    # sphinxcontrib-jupyter Configuration Settings
    # --------------------------------------------

    # Conversion Mode Settings
    # If "all", convert codes and texts into jupyter notebook
    # If "code", convert code-blocks only
    jupyter_conversion_mode = "all"

    jupyter_write_metadata = True

    # Location for _static folder
    jupyter_static_file_path = ["_static"]

    # Configure Jupyter Kernels
    jupyter_kernels = {
        "python3": {
            "kernelspec": {
                "display_name": "Python",
                "language": "python3",
                "name": "python3"
                },
            "file_extension": ".py",
        },
        "julia": {
            "kernelspec": {
                "display_name": "Julia 0.6.0",
                "language": "julia",
                "name": "julia-0.6"
                },
            "file_extension": ".jl"
        }
    }

    # Configure default language for Jupyter notebooks
    # Can be changed in each notebook thanks to the ..highlight:: directive
    jupyter_default_lang = "python3"
 
    # Configure Jupyter headers
    jupyter_headers = {
        "python3": [
        ],
        "julia": [
        ],
    }

    # Prepend a Welcome Message to Each Notebook
    jupyter_welcome_block = "welcome.rst"

    # Solutions Configuration
    jupyter_drop_solutions = True

    # Tests configurations 
    jupyter_drop_tests = True

    # Add Ipython as Synonym for tests
    jupyter_lang_synonyms = ["ipython"]

    # Image Prefix (enable web storage references)
    # jupyter_images_urlpath = "https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter/raw/master/tests/_static/"

    #allow execution of notebooks
    jupyter_execute_notebooks = True 

    # Location of template folder for coverage reports
    jupyter_template_coverage_file_path = "/path_to_coverage_template.html"

    # generate html from IPYNB files
    jupyter_generate_html = True
    
    # html template specific to your website needs
    jupyter_html_template = "/path_to_html_template.tpl"
    
    #path to download notebooks from 
    jupyter_download_nb_urlpath = "https://lectures.quantecon.org"

    #allow downloading of notebooks
    jupyter_download_nb = True

Dependency of notebooks on other notebooks for execution can also be added to the configuration file above in the form of a dictionary. The key/value pairs will contain the names of the notebook files.
An example to illustrate this is as follows :-

.. code:: python

   # add your dependency lists here
   jupyter_dependency_lists = {
      'python_advanced_features' : ['python_essentials','python_oop'],
      'discrete_dp' : ['dp_essentials'],
   }

TODO
----

1. remove need for Jupyter headers from configuration
2. include support for adding output to In cells to give a precompiled look to generated notebook
3. `Issues list <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter/issues>`__
