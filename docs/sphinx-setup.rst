Setting up a Sphinx Project
===========================

This guide will show you how to setup a Sphinx based project to make
use of this Jupyter Extension.

Sphinx
------

A sphinx based project can be setup using ``sphinx-quickstart``

.. code:: bash

    sphinx-quickstart

this setup script will guide you through the setup process. All of 
these settings are adjustable later through the ``conf.py`` file that
will be generated as part of the quickstart script.

This will by default provide the basic infrastructure required. After
you follow the on-screen instructions you will be able to start writing 
your project using RestructuredText.
