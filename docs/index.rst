``sphinxcontrib-jupyter`` Documentation
=======================================

This sphinx extension can be used to build a collection of
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__ notebooks for Sphinx Projects.

.. note:: 

    It has mainly been written to support the use case of
    scientific publishing and hasn't been well tested outside of this
    domain. Please provide feedback as an issue to this 
    `repository <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter>`__.

One of the benefits of writing notebooks as ``RST`` files is to simplify
the task of version control.
