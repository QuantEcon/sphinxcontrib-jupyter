Code blocks
-----------

This is a collection to test various code-blocks

This is a **.. code::** directive

.. code:: python

    this = 'is a code block'
    x = 1
    no = 'really!'
    p = argwhere(x == 2)

This is another **.. code::** directive

.. code:: python

    from pylab import linspace
    t = linspace(0, 1)
    x = t**2

This is a **::** directive

::

    from pylab import *
    x = logspace(0, 1)
    y = x**2
    figure()
    plot(x, y)
    show()

This is a **.. code-block:: julia** test with showing snippet for another language *Julia*
and it is included as a non-execute cell

.. code-block:: julia

    using QuantEcon

~~However this **currently** means **.. code-block:: python** is also included as a non-execute 
cell [See `issue <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter/issues/51>`__]~~

This has been fixed by using jupyter_lang_synonyms = ["python"] in **conf.py** file. So **python**
will now be included alongside *python3*, *ipython*, and *pycon*.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd

No Execute
----------

This is a **.. code-block::** directive with **:class: no-execute**

.. code-block:: python
   :class: no-execute

    import numpy as np


Other Examples from rst2ipynb
-----------------------------

Support for Python doctest code blocks::

    >>> 1+1
    2
    >>> for x in range(3):
    ...      print x
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    >>> x = 1
    >>> x = 2

but the input to this cell is not parsed into separate blocks unlike `rst2ipynb <https://github.com/nthiery/rst-to-ipynb>`__

Function with pycon code block style:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> def f(a, b, c):
   ...     """Multiline
   ...     docstring
   ...
   ...     """
   ...     # a comment
   ...
   ...     return a + b + c
   ...
   >>> f(1, 2, 3)
   6

Output Test Cases
-----------------

**Note:** This sphinx extension does not currently parse blocks internally

Long Pandas DataFrame's with more than three digits in the index column will
have a ``...`` in the output which shouldn't be considered a Python line
continuation prompt:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> import pandas as pd
   >>> pd.DataFrame({'b': pd.np.arange(1000)}, index=pd.np.linspace(0, 10, 1000))
               b

Nested Code Blocks
------------------

Due to the linear structure of Jupyter notebooks (a list of cells),
many nested structures can't be rendered exactly. Nevertheless we want
to make sure that, despite some degrading, the end result is
reasonably readable, and code blocks are rendered as code cells.

The tests are taken from `rst2ipynb`, where many of them fail.

#. Nested code block A

   ::

       1+1

#.  Nested code block B

    ::

       1+1

#. Nested code block C; ok to fail? (the inner indent does not match the itemized text indent)

    ::

       1+1

The following note contains a code block -- and these get rendered as code-blocks which
breaks the note structure. This is the currently accepted solution.

.. NOTE::

   A code block in a note::

       >>> 1+1

   Another one::

       >>> 1+1


.. TOPIC:: Note

   A code block in a topic::

       >>> 1+1

   Another one::

       >>> 1+1

.. TOPIC:: Doubly nested code blocks

    #.  Foo

        ::

            1+1

        ::

            >>> def plus_grand_element(liste):
            ...     """
            ...     Renvoie le plus grand élément de la liste
            ...     EXAMPLES::
            ...         >>> plus_grand_element([7,3,1,10,4,10,2,9])
            ...         10
            ...         >>> plus_grand_element([7])
            ...         7
            ...     """
            ...     resultat = liste[0]
            ...     for i in range(1, len(liste)-1):
            ...         # Invariant: resultat est le plus grand element de liste[:i]
            ...         assert resultat in liste[:i]
            ...         assert all(resultat >= x for x in liste[:i])
            ...         if liste[i] > resultat:
            ...             resultat = liste[i]
            ...     return resultat
            >>> plus_grand_element([7,3,1,10,4,10,2,9])
            10

        Foo.

        Bla::

            >>> 1+1

        ok to fail? (missing mandatory new line after `::`)::
            >>> 1+1

.. TOPIC:: A code block in a list in a topic

    #.  Foo

        ::

	    >>> def fusion(l1, l2):
	    ...     sort(l1+l2)


Code Block with None
====================

A code block with none specified as highlighter

.. code-block:: none

   import numpy as np

should be a markdown block with no highlighting
