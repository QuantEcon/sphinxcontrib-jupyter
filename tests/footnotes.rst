Define the government's one-period loss function [#f1]_

.. math::
    :label: target

    r(y, u)  =  y' R y  + u' Q u


History dependence has two sources: (a) the government's ability to commit [#f2]_ to a sequence of rules at time :math:`0`


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The problem assumes that there are no cross products between states and controls in the return function.  A simple transformation  converts a problem whose return function has cross products into an equivalent problem that has no cross products.

.. [#f2] The government would make different choices were it to choose sequentially, that is,  were it to select its time :math:`t` action at time :math:`t`.
